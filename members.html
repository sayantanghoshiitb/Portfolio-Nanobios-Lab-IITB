<br>                    I have received the prestigious INAE Young Engineer Award 2010. I am also the recipient of the prestigious DBT-IYBA 2009 award. I have also been elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, 2011. Further, I have been awarded the Young Investigator awards from IIT Bombay (2010), DAE (2006) and DST (2006) and is also the recipient of technical awards from Intellectual Ventures Asia Pte Ltd. Six of my current projects have been submitted as patent applications to the US and Indian Patent Office. In a short duration of seven years at IIT Bombay, my team already published in over 35 international journals and I have also been awarded the prestigious BOYSCAST Fellowship from DST. My lab is focusing on developing technologies that can be commercialized and brought to use for the common man in India.

Understanding/Creating rationality among irrational things is my prime hobby.... Eg...Two packets of Tide detergent and an old Time magazine lie unused in my cupboard... Inference - "Time and Tide does wait for one!!!" .My current hobby is deciphering what my 10 months old son (as on 27/06/2014) is trying to say.... My Mantra - A) At Home: Have a fatherly attitude B) At 2nd Home (Nanobios Lab): Have a fatherly (seminarian) attitude!!!!!
